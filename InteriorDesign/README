#Interior Design Generator

Overview:  
This project generates professionally furnished versions of empty room images using AI-based image generation techniques. It supports multiple room types and evaluates the quality of the generated images using SSIM and LPIPS metrics.

Project Goal:  
Transform empty room images into realistic interiors while preserving the original layout, furniture placement, and lighting.

Technologies & Tools: 
- Stable Diffusion & DreamShaper (AI image generation)  
- ControlNet (depth-based conditioning)  
- Gradio (interactive web interface)  
- LPIPS & SSIM (image similarity metrics)  
- Python libraries: `torch`, `transformers`, `diffusers`, `Pillow`, `numpy`, `scikit-image`

How It Works:
1. User uploads an empty room image.  
2. User selects a room type (Master Bedroom, Children's Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen).  
3. The model generates a furnished version while keeping key furniture, layout, and lighting intact.  
4. Quality metrics (SSIM & LPIPS) are calculated to evaluate realism.

Usage:
python code/interior_design_ds.py   # Launch DreamShaper version
python code/interior_design_sd.py   # Launch Stable Diffusion version

Open the Gradio interface in your browser.
Upload the input image and select room type.
View the generated interior and metrics.

Sample Results:

Future Improvements:
Support more room types.
Add style transfer options.
Optimize generation speed on lower-end GPUs.
